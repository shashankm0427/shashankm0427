Subject: Review of Assigned Roles and Workflow Documentation

Hi Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request your assistance in verifying the roles and responsibilities outlined in our Squad Charter for the Data Acquisition team. Additionally, please take a moment to review the Workflow Definition documentation to ensure everything aligns with our current processes.

You can access these documents via the following links:
- **Squad Charter:** Squad Charter - Data Acquisition - Data Tribe - AIB IT Wiki
- **Workflow Definition:** Workflow/Policy Definition - Data Acquisition - Data Tribe - AIB IT Wiki

I have also attached the retrospective report for April, as well as past minutes. Please review these documents at your earliest convenience and feel free to add any comments or suggestions you might have.

Thank you for your attention to these matters.

Best regards,
Shashank

This version maintains the original intent but presents the information more formally and directly, which is often preferred in professional communications.
### What Went Well
- **Adaptation to Agile Methods:** Our transition to agile methodologies is progressing smoothly, with regular scheduling of board meetings and other essential activities.
- **Team Communication:** Continuous improvement in internal communication has been evident, supporting effective system integration testing and prompt resolution of queries.

### What Didn't Go Well
- **Database Management Issues:** Challenges arose from not properly isolating development environments, leading to potential risks when testing changes due to reliance on local databases instead of using controlled settings.

### Actions
- **Database Handling Strategy:** We have decided to use more rigorous change management tools for modifying databases post-initial tests. This should prevent issues from local environment dependencies and ensure smoother transitions to production.
- **Improving Project Management:** To better manage our resources and deadlines, we plan to enhance our understanding of project capacity and prioritize financial and operational requirements more clearly. This includes setting definite expectations for project deliverables and adjusting time allocations for user story refinement to prevent overcommitment.

This revision maintains the key points but adapts the language and details to better fit your specific team and situation.

Certainly! Based on the issue and resolution you've provided, here's how you can structure it into the "What Went Well," "What Didn't Go Well," and "Actions" sections of your retrospective document:

### What Went Well
- Efficient deployment of changes and code, ready for testing.

### What Didn't Go Well
- Delays in testing due to challenges in coordinating with the BAT tester.

### Actions
- Implement a new procedure to inform the BAT tester ahead of time about upcoming testing requirements. Confirm the BAT tester's availability for the next week to ensure timely testing of newly deployed changes or code.

This structured format will help you clearly document the problem and the steps taken to address it in your team retrospective.
